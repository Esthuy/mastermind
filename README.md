# Mastermind

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.4.

## About this project

This project was done during my training at Technifutur. It was my first Angular project and it was done without any service, so there are a lot of Input/Output.
Now that I'm aware of services existence and uses, I'm working on other projects with services. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Further help
